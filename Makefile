# Rebuild-then-verify automation.
#
# The rule this enforces used to be manual discipline in README.md: "after
# editing anything in prompts/, memory/, or knowledge/, rebuild and run
# run-persona.py". Manual discipline is the kind that gets skipped on the one
# commit that breaks the identity rule, so it lives here instead.
#
#   make build   rebuild only the models whose prompt stack changed
#   make check   rebuild those, then run the persona suite over all of them
#   make persona run the persona suite without rebuilding
#   make hook    install the pre-commit hook that runs `make check`
#   make clean   drop the build stamps, forcing a full rebuild next time
#
# Every builder assembles the SAME prompt stack, so any edit under prompts/,
# memory/, or knowledge/ invalidates every model. The per-model stamp still
# matters: it means editing one builder's PARAMS rebuilds only that model, and a
# no-op `make check` costs nothing but the persona run.
