"""
Shared judge-panel helpers for run-learn.py and run-tutor.py.

Both runners grade free-text explanations with a leave-one-out panel of local
models. This module holds the parts that are identical between them: building the
judge prompt (with an optional stricter rubric), parsing the judge's JSON scores,
and the reliability stats — parse rate, inter-judge disagreement, under-judged
warnings — that say how much to trust the resulting /10 numbers. The rubric
dimensions and base template stay in each runner; only the mechanics live here.
