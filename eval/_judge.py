"""
Shared judge-panel helpers for run-learn.py and run-tutor.py.

Both runners grade free-text explanations with a leave-one-out panel of local
models. This module holds the parts that are identical between them: building the
judge prompt (with an optional stricter rubric), parsing the judge's JSON scores,
and the reliability stats — parse rate, inter-judge disagreement, under-judged
warnings — that say how much to trust the resulting /10 numbers. The rubric
dimensions and base template stay in each runner; only the mechanics live here.

Two independent noise sources sit under every /10 in these suites, and they need
different fixes:

  * BETWEEN judges — one model's taste is not a measurement. Fixed structurally by
    the panel: leave-one-out over a 3-model lineup gives 2 judges per response.
    With only 2 models it gave 1, and inter-judge disagreement was uncomputable.
  * WITHIN a judge — the same judge re-reading the same response does not always
    return the same JSON. Fixed by `repeats`: score N times and take the MEDIAN,
    so one anomalous sample cannot move the number. Median, not mean, because a
    judge that misfires tends to misfire hard (a 2 read as a 0), and a mean lets
    that single outlier drag the score.

`judge_total()` handles the within-judge half and reports the spread it saw, so
the summaries can show whether the repeats were needed or were noise-free.
