"""
Shared plumbing for the eval runners (run-content.py = content, run-code.py = coding).
Stdlib-only; talks to the local Ollama HTTP API. No task scoring lives here —
each runner owns its own scorer and summary. This file is the transport plus the
helpers the runners share, including the uncertainty-reporting helpers (Wilson
confidence interval, small-sample caveats, close-result notes, per-task spread)
that keep small runs from being over-read. Those helpers are scoring-agnostic:
they format counts/rates a runner already computed, they don't decide pass/fail.
