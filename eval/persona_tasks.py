"""
Prompt-stack battery for run-persona.py: does the assembled system prompt
actually get obeyed?

Every other suite measures the *base model* through the stack — coding ability,
content format, long-context recall. None of them test the thing this repo
actually builds. These tasks do: each one targets a specific rule written in
`prompts/`, `memory/`, or `knowledge/` and fails when the response violates it.

That makes this the regression suite for prompt edits. If you compress
`prompts/system.md` and the identity rule stops holding, only this suite tells
you. Each task carries the `rule` it enforces so a failure points at the file to
fix.

Scoring is deterministic regex, like content_tasks.py — no LLM judge, so results
are comparable run to run. `evaluate` returns at least: clean (bool), flags (str,
"clean" when nothing tripped). A task is clean iff every rule it checks holds.

Adding tasks: prefer rules that are high-consequence and mechanically checkable.
Rules like "no closing summary unless the answer was long enough" are real but
not deterministically testable; leave those to human review rather than encoding
a scorer that lies.
