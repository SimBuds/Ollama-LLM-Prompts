"""
Learning/tutor benchmark: which local model best ASSISTS with coding + learning,
not just which writes correct code. Each task asks for working code PLUS a
teaching explanation. Scoring is two-part:

  1. Execution gate — the model's code block must pass the hidden asserts.
  2. Explanation score — graded 0–10 on a fixed rubric (approach, complexity,
     alternative, pitfall, clarity) by a LEAVE-ONE-OUT JUDGE PANEL: every
     response is scored by all judge models EXCEPT the one that wrote it, and
     the scores are averaged. This removes the self-grading bias a single judge
     would introduce.

A "teach score" per attempt = explanation score when the code passes, else 0
(a great explanation of broken code doesn't help you learn correct coding).
Models are ranked by mean teach score; the summary also reports raw pass rate
and raw explanation score so you can see both halves.

Runs in two phases to avoid model thrash under OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS=1:
generate every response first (each model loaded once), then judge by looping
over the panel (each judge loaded once).

Usage:
  ./eval/run-learn.py --models gemma qwen                 # panel = both, leave-one-out
  ./eval/run-learn.py --models gemma --judges qwen        # grade gemma with qwen
  ./eval/run-learn.py --models gemma qwen --tasks lru_cache edit_distance --attempts 5

Leave-one-out means a response is graded only by judges other than its author, so
every model under test needs at least one judge with a different name. A single
model with the default panel has no eligible judge and is refused up front.

Output:
  eval/runs/<UTC>/learn/
    summary.md
    <model>/<task>-attempt-<n>.md     # full response + per-judge panel scores
